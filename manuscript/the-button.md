# The Button

A good app has a consistent visual language, and a well-maintained style guide. One typical element of such a style guide is the standard action button.

It is likely to be rectangular, with somewhat rounded corners, some sort of pseudo-relief effect and various styles of shadow. Font is, of course, very significant. Colour options are also a defining feature. Bootstrap 3, for example, defines "default" and "primary" types of buttons (in addition to a few others). The primary button is prominent and colourful, and the default button, well, sort of blends in.

Let's use the standard button as an opportunity to introduce visual components as a concept, and look at how classic code modularity techniques plug into the browser world.
