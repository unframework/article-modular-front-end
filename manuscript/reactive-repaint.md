Reactive programming is a popular buzzword for front-end frameworks. AngularJS and React are the two behemoths that have made that strategy a mainstay of front-end discussion (not to say that they were first to use it).

In Angular-land it has often been conflated with "two-way binding", but the latter is a separate concept that builds *on top* of the Angular approach to reactive programming.
