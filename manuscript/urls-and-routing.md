# URLs and Routing

Every front-end framework comes with a router implementation. Map client-side hash-fragment or `pushState` history to some sort of code. They all seem to provide a fairly consistent way to declare a set of routes (as URL patterns) and detect when those become active. Some will go further and allow for an hierarchical state approach (such as Angular UI Router).

Is that it? Is there nothing deeper to learn, and especially improve? Because it's not like typical production router usage is that easy on the eyes - repetitive lists of URL patterns, calling out to route triggers, suspiciously looking like an if-then covered in syntactic sugar.

Yes, it is possible to avoid, but as usual we want to be thoughtful and deliberate as we split our code into components. So what is it that we are modeling with all of this anyway?
