Intermediate and up frontend-devs.

Core Points
-----------

Set up a landscape/context: bigger apps (not content-driven websites).

Break out of framework-of-the-day inertia, and look at componentization/modularization basics. Then port that back to world of DOM/CSS. Start with the runtime model and then see what feeds into that.

Specific intersections of topics:

- routes (UI state orthogonal to components on page)
- runtime DOM vs HTML-as-authoring-syntax
- inline styles are not evil
- virtual DOM
